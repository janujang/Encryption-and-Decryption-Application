README for Super Spy Encryption and Decryption Program

1) Start the program by opening StartScreen.java and proceed by following instructions

2) There are two modes: File Mode and Live Mode. File Mode is used primarily for loading in files and outputting a file with encryption or decryption based on mode selected. Additionally, the user is also able to view the output file directly on the program. The Live Mode is extremely useful for viewing encryption and decryption side by side and switching between them. This mode is not made for inputting files, rather typing text and seeing changes real time. Thus, it provides a live experience as the name implies. 

3) Added functionality: There is a generate key and generate text button for convenience and ease of use. Particularly, the generate key button can be used to generate a value between -32767 and +32768 for the encrypt/decrypt key. The generate text button is only available on live mode and can be used to generate random phrases from a text file. 

4) Testing: The Encryption class has testing in the self-testing method. It allows me as the programmer to test by entering new words through JOptionPane.showInputDialog.

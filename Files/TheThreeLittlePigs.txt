Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother in a meadow. One day the mother pig said to the three little pigs, "You need to go out into the world and make your own way." So they waved "goodbye" and out into the world they went.The pigs decided to build houses near the woods. A big bad wolf lived in the woods. He was not happy when he saw the three little pigs building houses nearby.The first little pig was lazy. He made a house of straw. The big bad wolf huffed and puffed and blew it down.The second little pig worked a little harder than the first little pig. He made a house of twigs. The big bad wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house down.The third little pig made a house of bricks. The big bad wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed. But the house did not fall down. This made the big bad wolf very, very angry. He went up on the roof and tried to get into the house through the chimney. He climbed into the chimney and slid down into a pot of boiling water. He ran out of the house and never came back!
